I'm only human, I'm only, I'm only

I'm only human, human

Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind

Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind

Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm lying

But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all

Don't put your blame on me, don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror and what do you be

Do you see it clearer or are you deceived, in what you belive
